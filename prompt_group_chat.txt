Generate a simulated WhatsApp-style chat log between multiple participants with the following format:

[DD/MM/YY HH:MM:SS] Alice: Message1
[DD/MM/YY HH:MM:SS] Bob: Message2
...

Ensure that the chat spans over different days and includes conversations on various topics. 
You can customize the names of the participants, messages, emoji, and timestamps as needed. 
You can also have a participant send more than one message in a row; it doesn't have to be a back-and-forth. 
Leave no space between different days.

Be sure to include some omitted media that has been deleted because the chat is exported without media. The format in this case is:

[DD/MM/YY HH:MM:SS] Alice: <Media omitted>

The goal is to create a diverse and extended conversation that can be used for testing and development purposes in a WhatsApp Chat Analysis project.
